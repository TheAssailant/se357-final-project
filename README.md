# Web-based Engineering Final Project

This was my submission for my Web-based Engineering class' final project, course SE-357 at Monmouth Univeristy.

The assignment was to create essentially an Amazon clone using PHP and MySQL with multiple user types with different permissions.

You'll notice issues like SQL injection vulnerabilities and XSS vulnerabilities are present within the project. **I would strongly recommend against using any code involving SQL or displaying user input.** Ensuring all user input is properly sanitized and escaped is absolutely essential for websites in production. If you're looking for a guide on protecting your PHP applications from these vulnerabilities, I recommend starting with [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jKylhJtPmI).
